# RPG


A console application in C# for creating RPG (Role Playing Game) characters.

This application contains functionality to create and test RPG characters. A character has three primary
attributes; strength, dexterity, and intelligence. These attributes increase when the character increases
its level. A character can belong to one of four classes; mage, ranger, rogue, or warrior. Each class
focuses on one of the primary attributes. That attribute determines the damage dealt by the character.
Characters can also equip items in the form of weapons and armour. Weapons and armour increase the 
character's damage. Weapons increase  character damage depending on their own damage and attack speed. 
Armour increases damage by improving the character's own primary attributes. If a character does not have 
a weapon equiped they deal a standard damage of 1.

The application includes a unit test suite covering the functionality of the application. These tests
focus primarily on character attributes and equiping weapons and armour.
